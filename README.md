Toogles: Awesome Goggles for YouTube
====================================

Toogles is a super fast and super clean alternative interface for YouTube.
It's built for people who want to watch and browse and search without the
bulk that comes along with YouTube.com

Toogles is built on top of Angular.js (no jQuery) and Zurb Foundation.

### Contributing

Toogles is a single page JS app with no back end, so it's incredibly easy
to set up locally. Just download the repo and open up the /app directory in
your browser.

Note that you have to set it up as a vhost because the site
can't query YouTube if you're using the file:// protocol due to browser
restrictions.

Feel free to hack on it to fix any bugs you find or add any features you'd
like and send them in as a pull request. I'll add you to the contributors section!
